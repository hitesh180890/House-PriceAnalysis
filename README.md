# House-PriceAnalysis
The project performs data preprocessing, including encoding categorical variables and creating new features like house age and renovation weight. Visualizations such as histograms and correlation plots are used to uncover patterns and relationships among features. Multiple regression models are built and evaluated to accurately predict house prices based on the available features.
